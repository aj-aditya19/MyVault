I am currently working on MyVault, a personal growth and expense management application designed mainly for students. As of January, I am actively handling 4+ projects for hackathons and personal development while also learning Flutter. This project is currently 40% completed, with the remaining work focused on UI/UX design.

Completed Features
-Backend architecture and core logic
-Goal tracking (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
-Learning, rules, and quotes management
-Expense tracking logic

Remaining Work
-UI/UX design and screen implementation
-Final testing and polishing
-Local storage managine.

I have not shared this project publicly yet because it is still in an early stage and requires proper UI/UX before release. On 7 February 2026, I will complete the remaining work and officially publish the project on GitHub, making it available for everyone.

Thank you, I hope this project helps students stay organized and improve their personal growth and financial discipline.

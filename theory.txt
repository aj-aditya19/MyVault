Problem Statement - People set goals, learn daily, spend money, and make rules for life, but these are scattered across notebooks, apps, and memory. There is no single platform that tracks personal growth, discipline, and finances together in an organized and offline-first way.

Introduction - I want to make an App in which a user can set their goals, their quotes, their learning, their rules of life and more and also see the money he is spending per month or per day. In this a user can set their daily goals, monthly goals, yearly goals, weekly goals and record them and get notification about that goals to complete them at time. It helps them to see that what they does in the entire month , week, or in a day also. So this is the basic idea of this.

Target - Students - focus only on them only.

Pages - Schedule
	Task - day, weeks, months, year
	Quotes - like what they learn, or what they gain ( knowledge ).
	Rules - The rules which he/she want's to follow in their life
	Learning - learning of his/her life
	Money - in this it sees their money records

Core Features ->>
	-> Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Yearly goals
	-> Task reminders & notifications
	-> Quotes & life lessons storage
	-> Personal rules tracking
	-> Learning journal
	-> Expense tracking (daily & monthly)
	-> Offline-first storage
	-> Analytics (what user did in a day/week/month)

Future plans -> Personal AI assistant - help them to achieve their goals
	      Family or friends integration - can also connect with family members or friends

Tech Stack-> Flutter - for app
	     React.js - for web
	     Local storage - helps to store data locally and work offline
	     Node.js, Express.js - for backend

Deadline ->  22-01-2026     
Hours    ->  44 hours { as planned }
Chances  ->  10%

Plan - The plan that I believe that if I work according to the plane then i will make the project that i want to make as that was my aim.
